###Something

(#\s)[A-Za-z]*/g - Appears to work but captures #s as well
(?<=#\s)[A-Za-z]*/g - Seems like this is the best option although it says it has poor browser support


```

```

((?<=`*\s)[A-Za-z]*(?!`))*\s - works but have no damn clue why
(?<=`js\s+)[A-Za-z]*(?!`)\s - seems to work for `js
^(```js)+\s+[A-Za-z]*\s+(```)/gs - captures the entire string
